# NextFlow


**NextFlow** is a premium, Krea-style workflow automation platform that leverages the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) to process images, videos, and text in a cohesive, visual workspace. Build, execute, and restore complex data processing pipelines with a high-performance drag-and-drop interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎨 Visual Workflow Builder
Built with **React Flow (@xyflow/react)**, NextFlow provides a rich, interactive canvas:
- **Drag & Drop Nodes**: Easily add processing steps to your workspace.
- **Smart Connections**: Directional edges with type-safe validation (e.g., preventing image output from connecting to text input).
- **DAG Guardrails**: Automatic cycle detection to ensure acyclic graph (Directed Acyclic Graph) integrity.
- **Dynamic UI**: Responsive and fluid layout with Framer Motion animations and a glassmorphic dark-mode aesthetic.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Intelligence
Integrated with **Google Gemini (Generative AI)** for advanced multimodal capabilities:
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Analyze images, videos, and text simultaneously within a single node.
- **Custom Prompt Chaining**: Feed the output of one AI node into another, or combine multiple image/text sources for complex reasoning.
- **Vision-to-Text**: Direct Base64 processing for high-fidelity visual description and analysis.

### 🖼️ Media Manipulation & Tools
Native support for common image and video tasks:
- **Frame Extraction**: upload a video and extract specific frames at any timestamp (seconds or percentage) using **FFmpeg** for targeted AI analysis.
- **Image Cropping**: Precision cropping with coordinate and dimension controls to focus on specific regions of interest.
- **File Management**: Seamless asset handling with integrated file uploading via **Transloadit**.

### ⚡ Asynchronous Execution & Coordination
NextFlow uses **Trigger.dev v3** to handle distributed background workflows:
- **Topological Coordinator**: A robust engine manages the complex dependency chain of your DAG, ensuring nodes execute only when their inputs are ready.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track execution status (Running, Success, Failed) and view live outputs directly on the canvas and history sidebar.

### 🕰️ Workflow History & "Time Machine"
- **Run History**: Complete log of every workflow execution, including inputs, outputs, and durations.
- **One-Click Restore**: Mistake-proof your creative process with a "Time Machine" feature that allows you to restore any previous version of your workspace from its run history.
